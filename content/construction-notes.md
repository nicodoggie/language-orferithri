### Stops

The orferi, the beings who speak orferithri, have two primary differences in
comparison to humans in terms of speech articulators: their lips are rigid
and are not airtight, and they do not have teeth. In practicem this seems to be
equivalent to having their "labials" and "dentals" functionally merged together.
A notable consequence of this sort of anatomy is that it is generally impossible 
for the orferi to produce a bilabial stop. In this reference grammar, we use the
stem "labial" to describe this articulator despite their difference from human lips. 

While it is quite possible for the orferi to produce stops in other positions (the 
bilabial ones could be easily replaced with linguolabials), with the notable exception
of the uvular stop, it seems that the orferithri language does not incorporate these 
sounds in its phonology.

#### Uvular Stops 

Uvular stops /ʔ/ are quite rare in the orferithri lexicon. They only occur on the onset 
of the initial syllable, then is lenited to a /χ/ if a prefix is added to the stem.

### Fricatives

Fricatives available in orferithri are the voiced and voiceless bilabials, /ɸ/ and /β/,
the voiced and voiceless post-alveolars /ʃ/ and /ʒ/, and the voiced and voiceless 
linguolabials /θ̼/ and /ð̼/. 

The bilabial fricatives /ɸ/ and /β/ along with the post-alveolar fricatives /ʃ/ and /ʒ/ 
are the only coda consonants found in orferithri phonology. It seems they _must_ be 
followed by a _voiced fricative_.
