# Introduction

Most of the material presented in this document is related to the extant orferi language 
called orferithri. Aside from the sound changes that occurred as has been gleaned as a 
result of comparative analysis of the languages that Proto-Orferic has spawned, very little
has been said about the morphosyntax of the proto-language. Presented in this document is
the current state-of-the-art in the research on Proto-Orferic. 

# Phonology

The phonology of Proto-Orferic had been reconstructed from the many Orferic languages the most 
studied of these are Orferithri, Helztaeri, Azhari and Asati.


|               | Bilabial | Linguolabial | Alveolar | Post-alveolar | Glottal |
| ------------- | :------: | :----------: | :------: | :-----------: | :-----: |
| Stop          |          | p̼, b̼         |          | t, d          | ʔ       |
| Nasal         | m        | n̼            |          |               |         |
| Tap/Trill     |          |              |          | r             |         |
| Fricatives    |          |              | s, z     |               | h       |
| Approximants  |          |              |          |               |         |


# Sound Changes

Proto-Orferic, through the steady stride of history, had changed and split as the people who've
spoken the language had dispersed throughout the land. Some had changed more remarkably than others
but the two at both ends of the spectrum, Orferithri and Asari, represent the closest and the 
furthest from Proto-Orferic, respectively. As such, most of the sound changes to be discussed in 
this document would pertain to these most often. Other child languages may be referenced as needed
when it contributes to either of the aforementioned languages.

The most obvious cognate at the get go, would be the name of the race that speak these languages.
Known as the _Orferi_ to the tongue of men, and in Orferithri as well, it can be easily gleaned
that Orferi, Helztre, Arzha and Asari are very similar. The reconstructed Proto-Orferic word is
