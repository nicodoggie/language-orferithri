## Verbs

Most verbs have the final syllable ending in the close front unrounded vowel /i/, but simply note
that not all words that have final /i/ are verbs. Irregular verbs also exist and are dealt with,
in certain situations, by adding a -ri suffix to the end.

Verbs are prefixing and infixing, and tense is denoted by replacing the word-final syllable's 
nuclear vowel.

### Statives and Actives

Verb pairs of statives and actives exist in proto-orferic, where the difference between these
are encoded by stress. Stative verbs usually have initial stress, active ones have penultimate
stress.

Some pairs:

| ˈris.ba | to be sunny   | ris.ˈba | to shine       |
| ˈpi.hi  | to be beside  | pi.ˈhi  | to move beside |
| ˈʔaz.hi | to be careful | ʔaz.ˈhi | to care for    |

Although a sizable number of these pairs exist in the language, there are a non-trivial
number of verbs that do not have these pairs, or have these pairs, but correspond to 
actives and noun roots instead.

### Tense

Past tense is encoded by replacing the final close front unrounded /i/ vowel with the 
open front unrounded /a/ vowel.

Future tense is encoded by replacing the final close front unrounded /i/ vowel with the 
open front unrounded /e/ vowel.

Irregular verbs that do not end in an /i/, add a suffix -ra for past, and -re for future
tenses. A suffix -ri is added in present tense irregular verbs if a non-infinitive


### Aspect

Aspect marking and voice marking are intertwined in this language, and are encoded as 
infixes or prefixes attached to the verb. The infix that is inserted also depends upon the tense
marking also encoded by the word-final vowel

An unmarked verb is agent focus, present ɡnomic:

<div data-gloss class="orferi-gloss">
  <p class="gloss__line--free">ʔazhi ʔiziʔo no reti ma</p>
  <p>ʔazhi ʔiziʔo no reti ma</p>
  <p>{to care for} gio -NOM cat -ACC</p>
  <p class="gloss__line--free">Gio cares for the cat.</p>
</div>

<div data-gloss class="orferi-gloss">
  <p class="gloss__line--free">It's sunny.</p>
  <p class="gloss__line--free">ˈris.ba</p>
</div>

Prefixes are object focus:
| past    | gnomic      | ʔa-      | ʔa.nes.ˈha    |
|         | habitual    | ʔa- HAB~ | ʔa.na.ˈnes.ha |
|         | proɡressive | ʔa- θa-  | ʔa.θa.ˈnes.ha |
| present | ɡnomic      |          |               |
|         | habitual    | HAB~     | ne.ˈnes.hi    |
|         | proɡressive | θi       | θi.ˈnes.hi    |
| future  | ɡnomic      | ʔe-      | ʔe.nes.ˈhe    |
|         | habitual    | ʔe- HAB~ | ʔe.ne.ˈnes.he |
|         | proɡressive | ʔe- θe-  | ʔe.θe.ˈnes.he |
   

| present |   | ʔi- |
| future  |   | ʔe- |






## Nouns

Nouns have a gender system that is described in the initial syllable's vowel.
