## Verbs

Most verbs have the final syllable ending in the close front unrounded vowel /i/, but simply note
that not all words that have final /i/ are verbs. Irregular verbs also exist and are dealt with,
in certain situations, by adding a -ri suffix to the end.

Verbs are prefixing and infixing, and tense is denoted by replacing the word-final syllable's 
nuclear vowel.

### Statives and Actives

Verb pairs of statives and actives exist in proto-orferic, where the difference between these
are encoded by stress. Stative verbs usually have initial stress, active ones have penultimate
stress.

Some pairs:

| ˈris.ba | to be sunny   | ris.ˈba | to shine       |
| ˈpi.hi  | to be beside  | pi.ˈhi  | to move beside |
| ˈʔaz.hi | to be careful | ʔaz.ˈhi | to care for    |

Although a sizable number of these pairs exist in the language, there are a non-trivial
number of verbs that do not have these pairs, or have these pairs, but correspond to 
actives and noun roots instead.

### Valency

Stative verbs are usually monovalent (intransitive), meaning it only takes one argument. There are some statives 
however, that are _avalent_, meaning that these verbs do not take arguments (usually these are verbs describing 
environmental background states like the weather). Statives take a patient whose state is being described 
as an argument.

Take for example the sentence _Gio's mother is beautiful_.

<div data-gloss class="orferi-gloss">
  <p class="gloss__line--free">ˈbeh.bi ta.ˈma ta ʔiziho</p>
  <p>ˈbeh.bi ta.ˈma ta ʔiziho</p>
  <p>{to be beautiful} mother POSS Gio</p>
</div>

These statives may also have their valency increased based on the voice that they take.
For example, if the verb is inflected with the past inchoative, it takes the semantic meaning of
having some agent change the state of the patient into the state described by the verb. 

<div data-gloss class="orferi-gloss">
  <p class="gloss__line--free">The barber made Gio's mother beautiful</p>
  <p class="gloss__line--free">ˈbehah.ba azerada no ta.ˈma ta ʔiziho</p>
  <p>ˈbe<ha>h.ba azerada no ta.ˈma ta ʔiziho</p>
  <p><PST.INC>{to be beautiful} barber A mother POSS Gio</p>
</div>

### Prodrop

If the head is a di-valent stative, and the agent is first person, the pronoun may be dropped.

<div data-gloss class="orferi-gloss">
  <p class="gloss__line--free">I have become part of the family.</p>
  <p>ˈba&lt;ha&gt;ni tanadehbe no</p>
  <p>&lt;INC&gt;.{to be part of} {the family} -ABS</p>
  <p>I have become part of the family</p>
/div>

The pronoun may also be kept, as an option, but it's more common in formal speech/writing

<div data-gloss class="orferi-gloss">
  <p class="gloss__line--free">I have become part of the family.</p>
  <p>ˈbahani tanadehbe no ʔima</p>
  <p>{to be part of} {the family} -ABS 1SG</p>
  <p>I have become part of the family<./p>
</div>


### Tense

Past tense is encoded by replacing the final close front unrounded /i/ vowel with the 
open front unrounded /a/ vowel.

Future tense is encoded by replacing the final close front unrounded /i/ vowel with the 
open front unrounded /e/ vowel.

Irregular verbs that do not end in an /i/, add a suffix -ra for past, and -re for future
tenses. A suffix -ri is added in present tense irregular verbs if a non-infinitive


### Aspect

Aspect marking and voice marking are intertwined in this language, and are encoded as 
infixes or prefixes attached to the verb. The infix that is inserted also depends upon the tense
marking also encoded by the word-final vowel

An unmarked verb is patient focus, present ɡnomic:

<div data-gloss class="orferi-gloss">
  <p class="gloss__line--free">ʔazhi reti ma ʔiziʔo</p>
  <p>ʔazhi reti ma ʔiziʔo  -∅</p>
  <p>{to care for} cat -ABS Gio -ERG</p>
  <p class="gloss__line--free">The cat is cared for by Gio.</p>
</div>

Prefixes are patient focus, and are able to encode certain aspects:

| Tense   | Aspect      | Affixes  | Example       | Meaning              |
| ------- | ----------- | -------- | ------------- | -------------------- |
| past    | simple      | ʔa-      | ʔa.nes.ˈha    | ate                  |
|         | habitual    | ʔa- HAB~ | ʔa.na.ˈnes.ha | was regularly eating |
|         | proɡressive | ʔa- θa-  | ʔa.θa.ˈnes.ha | was eating           |
| present | simple      |          | nes.hi        | eat                  |
|         | habitual    | HAB~     | ne.ˈnes.hi    | is regularly eating  |
|         | proɡressive | θi       | θi.ˈnes.hi    | is eating            |
| future  | simple      | ʔe-      | ʔe.nes.ˈhe    | will eat             |
|         | habitual    | ʔe- HAB~ | ʔe.ne.ˈnes.he | will regularly eat   |
|         | proɡressive | ʔe- θe-  | ʔe.θe.ˈnes.he | will be eating       |


<div data-gloss class="orferi-gloss">
  <p class="gloss__line--free">?ahazha reti ma ʔiziho</p>
  <p>ʔa- ʔazha -PST reti ma ʔiziho -∅</p>
  <p>PST.PFOC- {to care for} -PST cat -ABS gio -ERG</p>
  <p class="gloss__line--free">The cat was cared for by gio.</p>
</div>

Infixes are agent focus, and encode some aspects as well as some moods.

| Tense   | Aspect/Mood | Affixes  | Example                          | Meaning              |
| ------- | ----------- | -------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| past    | inchoative  | -ha-     | nehas.ˈha                        | started to eat       |
|         | durative    | -paha-   | nepahas.ˈha nito no ʔemerisba ha | Nito ate yesterday   |
| present | inchoative  | -hi-     | nehis.ˈhi                        | starting to eat      |
|         | durative    | -pihi-   | nepihis.ˈhi nito no              |                      |
| future  | inchoative  | -he-     | nehes.ˈhe                        | will start eating    |
|         | durative    | -pehe-   | nepehes.ˈhe                      |                      |


### Nominalization

Stative verbs may be nominalized by adding the prefix meri-, then changing the word-final /i/ in regular verbs
to /a/. Irregular verbs typically retain their word-final vowel. In some words which begin with the syllable 
_ri_, the nominalization prefix is shortened to simply me-. For example the the word _risba /ˈris.ba/_  which 
means _to be bright_ when nominalized becomes the word for sun, _merisba /me.ˈris.ba/_ instead of _meririsba_.

## Nouns

### Definiteness and number

Definiteness and number are encoded as a suffix on the noun. A noun unmarked for number is definite singular.

 -me indefinite suffix
 

Nouns have a gender system that is described in the initial syllable's 


it'hi ʔezaheza marˈhimena ta diza

I fucking work all day just to get shit when I get home!

bibiˈta toha risbamena rire ʔatanaˈra rerpa pisre no
